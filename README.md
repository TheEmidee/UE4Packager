# UE4 Packager

Python scripts to ( Build / Cook / Package / Archive / Patch ) Unreal Engine Projects

This is my very first program written in Python, so please be indulgent :) 

And do not hesitate to propose pull requests to fix or improve stuff!

## Usage

Call `packager.py` with the following mandatory positional arguments:
* "BuildEditor", "Build", "Cook", "BuildCook", "BuildCookArchive", "Patch"
* "Win64", "XboxOne", "PS4", "Switch"
* "Development", "Debug", "Shipping"

Another mandatory argument is the `-c` argument, which allows you to define an ini file where the script will pick some values which are "fixed" (like the path to the UE4 folder).

The full list of the accepted parameters can be found by calling the script with the `-h` flag.

The script does some sanity checks on the arguments you give to it to make sure everything is correct before calling RunUAT, and will exit prematurely with an error message so you can fix your command line. (For example, you must provide a version number when building a shipping package, or you must define against which release number you want to create a patch) 

Some options worth noting:

* `--backup_version` : if set, the packager will use RoboCopy to copy the output located in the archive directory to a backup location of your choice (defined by the argument --backup_directory_root).
* `--stub` : if set, the packager won't run any action, but will output in the console the processes it should use, with the arguments. This is useful to check if everything is allright before running the packager for real.
* `--build_option` : if set, you define an option which can affect the packaging process globally. It can be used to select a particular in regions, add specific C++ defines, or call custom functions (see below)

As a convenience, you will find some batch files in the `samples` folder which will call `package.py` with predefined options to quickly use the packager.

## Configuration override

You can use the `[CONFIG_OVERRIDES]` section of the ini file to conditionally override the arguments passed to the packager.

The packager will try to find options in the `[CONFIG_OVERRIDES]` which match a specific convention:

* {build_option}_ARGUMENT_NAME
* {platform}_ARGUMENT_NAME
* {configuration}_ARGUMENT_NAME
* {build_option}{platform}_ARGUMENT_NAME
* {build_option}{configuration}_ARGUMENT_NAME
* {platform}{configuration}_ARGUMENT_NAME
* {build_option}{platform}{configuration}_ARGUMENT_NAME

For example, provided you give `Demo` to `--build_option`, you could override the version_number argument like that:

````
[CONFIG_OVERRIDES]
Demo_version_number = Demo
````

Or you could define on which devices you want your game to be deployed per-platform:

````
[CONFIG_OVERRIDES]
PS4_deploy_device = PS4@192.168.0.1
````

Note that this step is executed first in the pipeline. This means that the final value of the arguments will be used in the next steps.

## Defines

You can use the `[DEFINES]` section of the ini file to add C++ preprocessor defines to the build. This is something we found useful when building our demos because this allowed us to add the `DEMO_BUILD=True` define.

The packager will try to find options in the `[DEFINES]` section, which match a specific convention:

* Defines_{build_option}
* Defines_{platform}
* Defines_{configuration}
* Defines_{build_option}{platform}
* Defines_{build_option}{configuration}
* Defines_{platform}{configuration}
* Defines_{build_option}{platform}{configuration}

For example, provided you give `Demo` to `--build_option`, you could have:

````
[DEFINES]
Defines_Demo = [ "DEMO_BUILD=True" ]
Defines_Demo_Switch = [ "DEMO_BUILD_SWITCH=True" ]
````

Please note that the options must define a list of strings to work properly.

## Regions

Consoles often require an additional parameter passed to RunUAT : `-titleid`, which is the identifier of your game in their store.

Since those ids are a bit cryptic to use, and are attached to a region of the world where the game is released, it's more convenient to use a `--region` flag to build the correct package.

You can use the `config.ini` file to define for each platform the regions you want to build your package for, and to specify the title id for each of those regions.

The packager script checks the ini file and will raise an exception if it can not find the region for the platform, or the title id for the region.

You can take as an example the `config.ini` file in this repository, which defines this *REGIONS* section:

````
[REGIONS]
PS4Regions = [ "Europe", "Japan" ]
PS4DefaultRegion = Europe
PS4Region_Europe = TitleId_Europe
PS4Region_Japan = TitleId_Japan
````

That config file defines the default region and 2 useable regions for the PS4 : Europe and Japan, and the title id for each region.

Right now, when given a `--region` parameter, the packager will copy the contents of the path `Project\Config\Platform\TitleId` inside `Project\Config\Platform\` as a step prior to calling `RunUAT`, and copy the contents of the path `Project\Config\Platform\DefaultTitleId` (defined by the DefaultRegion of the ini file) as a post step.

This is useful as you can create specific configuration of the ini files used by the engine for each region.

Some platforms also have an additional pre-step (and a post-step which restores the state of the files):
* the PS4 platform will copy the contents of `Project\Build\PS4\sce_sys\TitleId` in `Project\Build\PS4\sce_sys\`.
* The Switch platform will copy the contents of `Project\Build\Switch\Resources\TitleId` in `Project\Build\Switch\Resources\`.

Please note that using the `--region` flag will make `RunUAT` archive your project in a sub directory whose name is the `titleid` of the selected region.

You can also define a specific title id based on the `build_option` parameter. The name resolution is the same as the **Defines** section above.

This is useful if for example, you need a different title id for a demo, you would need to pass `Demo` as the `build_option`:

````
SwitchRegion_Europe = Switch_TitleId_Europe
SwitchRegion_Demo_Europe = Switch_Demo_TitleId_Europe
````

## Custom functions

Custom functions are a great way to extend the packager to your needs.

You can put python scripts in a folder (you need to pass as an argument with `--custom_folder`), to have custom functions called, depending on the selected build_option, platform, configuration.

The packager will automatically import any python file from that folder, and call any `Custom_XXX_Initialize`, `Custom_XXX_PreExecute` and `Custom_XXX_PostExecute` function inside.

`Custom_XXX_Initialize` is called right after the command line arguments and the config files are parsed, and is a great place to update the values which will be used by the packager. One useful thing we do for example is to change the `version_number` argument when the `build_option` is set to `Demo`. This allows us to archive the project in a dedicated directory.

`Custom_XXX_(Pre|Post)Execute` are called right after the calls to `Platform.(Pre|Post)Execute` and are a good opportunity to copy files around for example.

The naming convention follows what you can do for the defines above:

* Custom_{build_option}_(Pre|Post)Execute( args, path_resolver )
* Custom_{platform}_(Pre|Post)Execute( args, path_resolver )
* Custom_{configuration}_(Pre|Post)Execute( args, path_resolver )
* Custom_{build_option}{platform}_(Pre|Post)Execute( args, path_resolver )
* Custom_{build_option}{configuration}_(Pre|Post)Execute( args, path_resolver )
* Custom_{platform}{configuration}_(Pre|Post)Execute( args, path_resolver )
* Custom_{build_option}{platform}{configuration}_(Pre|Post)Execute( args, path_resolver )

You can have a look at the file `custom/demo_switch.py` for a working example.

Here is an example of the arguments to pass if you have your `config.ini` in the parent folder of the packager scripts folder, and a folder named `PackagerCustomScripts` as a sibling of the packager scripts:

```
py.exe .\UE4Packager\packager.py BuildCookArchive Switch Shipping -c config.ini --backup_version --custom_folder PackagerCustomScripts --build_option Demo
```
